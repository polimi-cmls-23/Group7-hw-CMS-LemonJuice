# ColorMixer

ColorMixer is an innovative sound-mixing application being developed by the LemonJUICE team. It allows users to manipulate the mix of a song using color, blending auditory and visual sensory experiences in an engaging and intuitive way.

## Features

- **Color Sensing**: Uses a TCS34725 RGB Color Sensor attached to an Arduino setup to capture user-presented colors.
- **Track Volume Control**: Adjusts the volume of individual tracks in a song based on the proximity of the scanned color to the reference colors assigned to each track (8 tracks per song).
- **Visual Feedback**: Provides dynamic visual feedback using Processing, based on OSC messages from JUCE.
- **User Control**: Includes a simple GUI for playing, pausing, looping, and switching songs.

Please note that ColorMixer is currently under active development and is not yet ready to be compiled without complete instructions. More details will be provided as we continue development.
